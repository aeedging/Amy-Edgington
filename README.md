Learning about using git as my version control system.

The 'README.md' file is a markdown file where I can share important notes about my code repository.

I can create **bold** text (wrapped by two asteriks) or *italic* text (wrapped by one asterik).

I can create fenced code blocks using back-ticks (alt+96 OR top left keyboard beside '1'), like this:

```csharp
public static void Main(string[]args)
{
  Console.WriteLine("Hello")'
 }
```
 
 Learning about:
 - Creating a git repository (online, and on my computer)
 - Synchronizing my git repository on [GitHub](https://github.com)
